"Chokepoint 2.0" is in full swing, especially now that [Banks are in a crisis of their own doing](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/17/business/global-banking-crisis-explained/index.html). Many have and will try to spin this as an excuse as to why Banks shouldn't work with crypto. Banks taking deposits from crypto companies or engaging in crypto custody are facing an onslaught from regulators & politicians. 

Silvergate Bank voluntarily wound down operations, eliminating the "Silvergate Exchange Network" or "SEN" which allowed many crypto exchanges to conduct banking and crypto transfers with other exchanges. Then came the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, although they weren't as involved with crypto as Silvergate or Signature Bank, they did have crypto companies with accounts such as [Circle](https://www.circle.com/blog/an-update-on-usdc-and-silicon-valley-bank) the issuer of the USDC Stablecoin. 


The most suspicious of all was Signature Bank being ["ordered"](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/12/regulators-close-new-yorks-signature-bank-citing-systemic-risk.html) by regulators to shut down not long after the FDIC had taken over Silicon Valley Bank. Signature Bank like Silvergate, was heavily involved in crypto, operating it's own network "Signet".  Barney Frank, a former board member of Signature Bank, said that regulators wanted “to send a very strong anti-crypto message” which played a role in shutting down the Bank. It was then reported that the purchaser of Signature Bank would be required to "give up" any crypto related business or activities, although the [FDIC has denied this report](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/17/fdic-denies-report-signature-bank-purchaser-must-divest-crypto/)

The banking crisis has now left crypto companies with very limited options when it comes to banking partners. Seeking new banking partners is a lost cause as most banks have been "warned of the risks" crypto poses. While the banking crisis was by no means a coordinated or planned effort by the government, make no mistake that they are using it to further their goal of cutting crypto off from the traditional finance industry.  


While the crypto industry struggles to find reliable banking partners, regulators with the SEC & CTFC are in full blown attack mode against crypto. The SEC and SEC Chair Gary Gensler has drastically increased its enforcement of crypto firms. Over the past 6 months the SEC has issued charges against U.S. crypto companies such as [Gemini Exchange](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-7), [Kraken Exchange](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-25), and also issued a [Wells Notice](https://www.reuters.com/legal/coinbase-issued-wells-notice-by-sec-2023-03-22/) to publicly traded crypto exchange Coinbase. 

The CTFC also recently announced charges against [Binance Exchange & CEO Changpeng Zhaou(CZ)](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8680-23). If the current attack on the crypto industry didn't seem harsh enough, Politicians are also waging their own war against crypto. Front & center is [Senator Elizabeth Warren who is proudly declaring war on crypto](https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/the-breakdown-with-nlw/elizabeth-warren-has-declared-war-on-crypto/) in her bid for re-election.


Let me be clear, **no one** can deny that crypto has some major issues to work out. As with any new innovative technology, there will be bumps & issues to work thru as it continues to grow & mature. There were also a lot of embarrasing, inexcusable failures over the past year, such as Terra/Luna, FTX, BlockFi, Celsius, Voyager & several others. Crypto does need a **clear** set of rules & regulations, it needs regulators that will act in good faith by protecting users while also being fair to crypto companies. Many in the U.S. crypto industry are simply asking the government, regulators & politicians to take a more positive and open approach with the crypto industry in the U.S. Pushing U.S. crypto companies off-shore & also falling behind other countries in the crypto & digital asset space will have dire consequences.

Between CBDCs & the rapidly decreasing privacy of U.S. citizens as well as other countries commitment to crypto & digital assets, this is a technological shift the U.S. **can not afford to lose**. The U.S. has been always been a leader and example for the rest of the world in protecting innovation and freedom. 

Thankfully the crypto industry *does* have supporters fighting for it that work in government. Congressman [Tom Emmer](https://twitter.com/GOPMajorityWhip), [Senator Cynthia Lummis](https://twitter.com/CynthiaMLummis), [Senator Rand Paul](https://twitter.com/RandPaul) are a few that have constantly voiced their support for the U.S. crypto industry. They have all devoted their time to learn about the crypto industry. As a result, they all have a keen understanding of the bigger picture that crypto can & will play in protecting the financial privacy & freedom of U.S. citizens & the potential damage that issuing a CBDC would cause.
