Death has a way of showing you just how meaningless most things are in the big picture. Sure your job, money & "things" matter a lot up until you have a few days left on earth. 
At that point nobody cares how much money you had, the kind of car you drove, or what your job title was. Your family cares only about the time they have left to spend with you & letting you know how much they love you.

Over your lifetime if you're lucky you will meet a handful of truly good men who leave a lasting impression on you. Hopefully one of those will be in your immediate family like your dad or brother. 
One of those good men I met along the way was my brother-in-law's dad. Let me start off by saying I've always been a "quiet" person who's pretty reserved around new people I meet, which means I normally get described
as seeming "anti-social" or told that I look "unapproachable". I totally understand why people feel that way, I just hate it that many people won't move past that point to actually have a conversation & get to know me. 

Well my brother-in-law's dad we call "Big Jack" is the polar-opposite of me lmao. He's a talkitive, brash, old school southerner who's never met a stranger & I think that's why we were able to quickly hit it off. 
His personality was to naturally get to know anyone & everyone without worrying what they "might" look like or be like. Eventually I landed a job at the place where he & my brother-in-law both worked it was also on the same shift as him. 
He only lived a few roads over from me so he eventually offered to let me ride to/from work with him, anytime they would cook he always made sure to bring me a plate of food to eat at work, he looked out for me & showed me the ins & outs of the job. 

Once I left that job I would usually only run into him during holidays like Thanksgiving & Christmas at my brother-in-laws house but he remained someone I felt comfortable talking too. He eventually got diagnosed with cancer but he remained fairly healthy over the next 2 or so years. It was only 
in the past year that things started to take a turn for the worse. A couple of days ago they told us he was in the hospital & today they moved him to hospice care. Thankfully we were able to go to visit him while he was still alert, I got to shake his hand & see him crack a small smile. 

The fact that he has very good reasons to not smile & instead be scared or upset, he still chose to smile. I think back all those years anytime I saw him he always had a huge smile. I can not even remember once where he seemed to be in a bad mood or 
just not feeling well yet I'm sure there were plenty of times he didn't feel like smiling, yet he still chose to smile. 

That's the lesson that I will carry with me. I definitely don't smile enough, I get in bad moods every other day & some days I worry myself sick. Hopefully 
now maybe I can stop myself, think of him & tell myself "just smile more".
